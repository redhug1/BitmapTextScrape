1. The font that is being grabed, its characters can not overlap any of their pixels into anothers bounding box.

2. Xoffset for font in .json file MUST start at first vertical column of character that has a non background coloured pixel in it.

3. At the end of 4_extract_Text, it the flag 'gatherCharacterCounts' has been set 'true' it will print out a New ordered list
   of a 'search' priority order for the found characters. This list might be missing some of the characters in the original
   font list ... so if you are going to create a new priority list in the variable 'extractionList', make sure it includes
   all of the original characters.

4. In the font's, the character '^' is used to signify a blank vertical column of pixels and can therefore not be in your font set.
   If you need it in your font set, you will have to replace the '^' in the font sets and where it is looked for in the code with your
   alternative.

5. Image manipulation commands of use:

	a) To create a smaller .bmp from a 32x32 pixel on down to 10x18

		convert -resize 10x18! some_image.bmp font_block_10x18.bmp

	b) To edit the pixels in this and retain the Alpha channel

		use Gimp to edit, then to save as original .bmp format ... the edited image has to be 'exported'.

	c) Having done a screen grab of whole screen with source window, to cut the window out
		of .png image called w2.png, do:

		convert w2.png -gravity North -chop 0x13 w3.png

		convert w3.png -gravity West -chop 10x0 w4.png

		convert w4.png -gravity East -chop 1400x0 w5.png

		convert w5.png -gravity South -chop 0x165 w6.png
